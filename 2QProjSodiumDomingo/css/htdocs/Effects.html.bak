		<p>Now that you know the causes of world hunger, let's take a look at the effects.

			</center>
			1. Desperation: Hunger can cause a lot of people to get desperate for food or money. Some people will resort to violence 
			and crimes and even selling their body just to get some money and food. This may seem absurd to some of you but it's true.
			People who are truly desperate for food will do anything to get it for them or their families. <br>

			</center>
			2. Malnutrition: As you know, food is one of the main sources of the vitamins and minerals your body needs to stay 
			healthy. People who are able to eat a regular diet daily are healthy and have a strong body. However, people who are not 
			able to eat regularly are malnourished and have a weak body. Since there is no nutrients in the bodies of the hungry, 
			their bodies suffer from reduced muscle and tissue mass, making them extremely underweight, weak and brittle. 
			Because of the lack of nutrients, their immune systems are weak and they are more prone to certain diseases and illnesses,
			especially breathing problems. <br>

			3. Lack of weight: Since they have no food to sustain themselves, the nutrients needed to keep your body strong such as
			carbohydrates, protein, and calories are deprived from their bodies. The lack of food causes them to lose weight and body 
			fat, making them skinny and underweight. There's nothing necessarily wrong with being underweight as long as you eat 
			healthy and regularly. However, if you don't, your body will be very weak and you will be prone to diseases such as 
			osteoporosis, and anemia. <br>
			<center>

			</center>
			4. Death: This might be the saddest and most devastating effect of hunger. Sadly, people die because of the malnutrition 
			and hunger they suffer. If you don't eat for a long period of time, your body will eat up the fat, protein storages, and 
			muscles in your body, including the heart muscle. Once all those nutrients have been consumed by your body, your heart 
			finally stops, bringing your life to an end. <br>
