			There is a handful of causes for world hunger. In the list below, you can see a few reasons why people are starving.

			</center>
			1. Poverty - Obviously you need money to buy the right amount of food for you and your family. Unfortunately, not everyone has that money. Because of
			their empty pockets and wallets, they cannot buy enough money to sustain themselves. Eventually they will eat all the food that they have left and when it 
			runs out, they will not be able to eat until they get money again. <br>
			<center>
				<img src = "C:\Users\ned\Documents\2QProjSodiumDomingo\css\htdocs\images\Natural Disaster.jpg" width = 254px height = 170px>
			</center>
			2. Natural Disasters - Natural Disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, typhoons, volcano eruptions, and cyclones can destroy more than what the victims 
			can rebuild. In the aftermath of the disaster, the victims of the tragedy usually try to rebuild what was destroyed such as their shelter, heal the wounds
			of their loved ones, and more. All of this costs a lot of money, maybe more than their entire life savings. So after they recover from the tragedy, they 
			will have little to no money for food or water. <br>
			<center>
				<img src = "C:\Users\ned\Documents\2QProjSodiumDomingo\css\htdocs\images\War.jpg" width = 267px height = 163px> 
			</center>
			3. War - War can destroy everything if it goes on for too long. If it goes for long enough, the destruction caused by bombs and more will destroy the 
			crops and houses of civilians. It will cost a lot of money for them to rebuild their houses and their crops will take too long to grow. Because of this,
			they will end up starving. <br>
			<center>
				<img class = "imgs" src = "C:\Users\ned\Documents\2QProjSodiumDomingo\css\htdocs\images\Climate Change.jpg" width = 240px height 160px>
			</center>
			4. Climate Change - The change of climates can cause the crops and animals of a farm die because the new climate is not fit 
			for them. Due to the loss of their plants and animals, their main source of food and money, they could become one of the 
			millions of people that are hungry. <br>
			Take note that there are so much more reasons why people are becoming hungry but these three are the most common causes of 
			world hunger. Please watch the video below to know more causes of hunger.
