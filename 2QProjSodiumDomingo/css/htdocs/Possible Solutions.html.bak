			Now that you know how devastating world hunger is, you probably want to know how to stop it. The following is a few ways you 
			can feed people.

				<img src="C:\Users\ned\Documents\2QProjSodiumDomingo\css\htdocs\images\Food Waste.jpg" width = 254px height = 169px>
			</center>
			1. Reducing Food Waste: The world has enough food to sustain everyone on Earth. The problem is that a third of that 
			produced food is wasted and thrown away. All that food would've been enough to feed over 2 billion people, twice the 
			number of people who are starving in the world. Not just that, when all the wasted food rots, it emits 3 billion tons of 
			greenhouse gases that damage the environment each year, making it one of the largest contributions to climate change and 
			global warming. According to multiple programs dedicated to solving world hunger, if we stop wasting food completely, 
			over 2 billion starving people will be fed and healthy. This can also lead to some benefits for the environment because 
			as you know, climate change can have some devastating effects to evrything. Since wasted food is one of its largest 
			contributions, if we put an end to that, it would be a huge step in stopping climate change.

			</center>
			2. Donation: People go hungry because of either poverty, or the lack of resources to get food for themselves. Because of 
			this, they need a helping hand to get the food that they desperately need. You can be that helping hand by donating money 
			or food directly to the poor or organizations who are helping to feed the poor. The poor can use that money and food to 
			sustain themselves and fill their empty stomachs.
			<center>
				<img src="C:\Users\ned\Documents\2QProjSodiumDomingo\css\htdocs\images\Equality.jpg" width = 200px height = 134px>
			</center>
			3. Equality: People sometimes discriminate others because of their gender, race, skin color, etc. and don't give the 
			food or any kind of help. Some people think another group of people are inferior and want to do bad things to them just 
			because they're not like them. Best thing we can do about this problem is spread awarenesss about the inequalities in 
			society and inspire equality among them. This will encourage the youth to fight for equal rights and help others.
			<center>
				<img src="C:\Users\ned\Documents\2QProjSodiumDomingo\css\htdocs\images\Community Programs.jpg" width = 204px height = 136px>
			</center>
			4. Programs: Most of humanity have good souls and have good intentions. These people come together and make programs to 
			help and inspire others to make the community a better place. There are programs dedicated to feeding the hungry and 
			stopping world hunger. Obviously, they cannot stop world hunger alone, but they can certainly feed some of the hungry. 
			While you do not need to support these programs, it would be great if you hear their messages so you know what is going 
			on in the world and you will help the hungry in your own way.
